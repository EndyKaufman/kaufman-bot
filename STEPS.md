# [2022-02-12 20:14] Create NX empty project

I decided to try to keep a twitter history of rewriting one of the projects, I'm starting...

## Creating an empty NX project

> npx create-nx-workspace

```sh
endy@endy-virtual-machine:~/Projects/current/kaufman-bot$ npx create-nx-workspace
Need to install the following packages:
  create-nx-workspace
Ok to proceed? (y) y
âœ” Workspace name (e.g., org name)     Â· kaufman-bot
âœ” What to create in the new workspace Â· empty
âœ” Use Nx Cloud? (It's free and doesn't require registration.) Â· No

>  NX  Nx is creating your workspace.

  To make sure the command works reliably in all environments, and that the preset is applied correctly,
  Nx will run "npm install" several times. Please wait.

âœ” Installing dependencies with npm
âœ” Nx has successfully created the workspace.
```
